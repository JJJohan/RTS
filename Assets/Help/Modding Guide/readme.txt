This game is designed with a data driven design to allow players to customize the game quite extensively. 
Players are able to replace units and buildings, and even create their own using a simple XML format.

See the included sample XML files for a template for constructing a new building or unit. 
A wide variety of models and texture formats are supported.

The upgrade system is designed to allow for a wide variety of choices.
For example, to elevate the restriction of linear upgrade paths, new models are added instead of 
replacing the original to allow for multiple combinations (Buildings only).
Upgrades may also be used as tech requirements.

A list of default building and unit names (useful for tech tree requirements) are as follows:

BUILDINGS

CONSTRUCTION_YARD
